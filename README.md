## What is this?
This is an [anylogger](https://npmjs.com/package/anylogger) adapter for the console.

This package is meant for application projects that are using libraries using
`anylogger`. By including this adapter in your project, all libraries using
`anylogger` will automatically start to use the browser console as their logging framework.

## CDN

*index.html*
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/anylogger@1.0.6/anylogger.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/anylogger-console@1.0.2"></script>
<script>(function(){ // IIFE
  var log = anylogger('index.html')
  log.info('Logging is simple!')
})()</script>
```

## Install

Install `anylogger` and this adapter:

```sh
npm install --save anylogger anylogger-console
```

## Include in your application project
This package is meant for application projects. If you are writing a library to
be NPM installed into some other project, most likely you should not include
any adapter, but instead just use `anylogger` directly.

The `anylogger-console` adapter will modify the `anylogger` factory in such a
way that the loggers it creates will be logging to the console.

To activate the adapter, include it in your application entry point.

### Require

*main.js*
```js
require('anylogger-console')
```

### Import

*main.js*
```js
import 'anylogger-console'
```

## Logging in the application project
In your application module code, only use anylogger to stay framework
independent:

*my-module.js*
```js
import anylogger from 'anylogger'
const log = anylogger('my-module')
log('Logging is simple!')
```

This is helpful if you ever decide to factor out the application module into a
separate library.
